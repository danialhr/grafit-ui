# Mapping of shadcn-ui variants/props to Flutter implementation
mapping:
  variants:
    # shadcn_variant_name: grafit_variant_name
    # Example:
    #   default: primary
    #   secondary: secondary
    #   ghost: ghost

  props:
    # Map shadcn props to Flutter equivalents
    # Example:
    #   onClick: onPressed (Gesture callback)
    #   disabled: disabled (Boolean)
    #   variant: variant (Enum)

# What features from shadcn-ui are NOT implemented
unimplemented:
  # - asChild: "React-specific pattern, Flutter uses child parameter"
  # - loading: "Can be added via optional loading prop in future"
  # - tooltip: "Will be added as separate wrapper component"

# Flutter-specific adaptations made during porting
adaptations:
  # - Gesture detection replaces onClick callback
  # - InkWell/Clickable wrapper for hover/focus states
  # - AnimatedContainer for transitions instead of CSS
  # - MediaQuery for responsive design instead of CSS breakpoints
