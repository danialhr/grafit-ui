    Accordion: GrafitAccordion
    AccordionItem: GrafitAccordionItem
    AccordionTrigger: GrafitAccordionTrigger
    AccordionContent: GrafitAccordionContent
    AccordionPrimitive.Root: GrafitAccordion (internal state management)
    AccordionPrimitive.Item: GrafitAccordionItem (data class)
    AccordionPrimitive.Trigger: GrafitAccordionTrigger (with internal widget)
    AccordionPrimitive.Content: GrafitAccordionContent
    AccordionPrimitive.Header: Handled internally by GrafitAccordionItemWidget

  props:
    type: type (GrafitAccordionType enum)
    collapsible: N/A (all items are collapsible by default)
    defaultValue: initialIndex (for single) / initialOpenIndices (for multiple)
    value: N/A (internal state management)
    onValueChange: onOpenChange
    disabled: disabled (on GrafitAccordionItem)

unimplemented: []

adaptations:
  - Added GrafitAccordionType enum (single/multiple) for type control
  - Added initialIndex/initialOpenIndices for initial state control
  - Added bordered/backgroundColor/padding props for container styling
  - Added showIcon prop on GrafitAccordionTrigger for icon visibility control
  - AnimationController-based smooth animations for expand/collapse
  - ThemeExtension-based theming instead of CSS classes
  - Helper functions (createAccordionItem, createAccordionItemWithContent) for convenience
  - MouseRegion cursor feedback for disabled state
  - FocusScope for keyboard navigation support
